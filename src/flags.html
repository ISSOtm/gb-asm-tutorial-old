<p>
    In this section, we will see new instructions at the same time as the flags, to help understand how instructions work with flags.
</p>

<h2>The <code>f</code> register</h2>
<p>
    <code>f</code> being an 8-bit register, it has 8 bits. Bits 0-3 are always zero. Bits 4-7 are called <code>C</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>N</code>, and <code>Z</code>, in that order. Note that, to avoid confusing register <code>c</code> and flag <code>c</code>, flags sometimes get an "<code>f</code>" appended to them (eg. <code>CF</code>, <code>ZF</code>). However, that notation will not work when referencing the flags in the source code &mdash; it's only useful for discussion.
</p>
<p>
    As always, each of these letters stands for something:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>c</dt><dd>Carry</dd>
    <dt>h</dt><dd>Half-carry</dd>
    <dt>n</dt><dd>Add/Subtract (ok, this one doesn't make sense)</dd>
    <dt>z</dt><dd>Zero</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Remember that flags are just bits of the <code>f</code> register. As such, a flag is said to be <em>set</em> when its corresponding bit is 1. (It thus equates to "true" by law of non-zero, but that doesn't matter a lot here.)
</p>

<h2>Z - Zero</h2>
<p>
    <code>Z</code> is the simplest flag of them all. It generally follows the rule of thumb "If the instruction's result was zero, then it's set; otherwise, it's reset." Simple enough. And to illustrate that, let's talk about <code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code>.
</p>

<h3><code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code></h3>
<p>
    <code>inc</code> has a simple purpose - <b>inc</b>rement a register's value. The purpose of <code>dec</code> is left as an exercise for the most alert of our readers. There are two flavors of <code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code>: 8-bit inc/dec and 16-bit inc/dec. 8-bit inc/dec affects the Z flag as you'd expect: if the register holds 0 <em>after</em> the operation, Z is set. Otherwise, it's reset. Note that, obviously, overflow applies, as demonstrated below.
</p>
<pre>
    ld b, $FF
    dec b
    ; B = $FE, Z reset
    inc b
    ; B = $FF, Z reset
    inc b
    ; B = $00, Z set
    inc b
    ; B = $01, Z reset
    dec b
    ; B = $00, Z set

    ld b, $FE
    ; B = $FE, Z set (keep in mind, `ld` doesn't affect flags!)
    inc b
    ; B = $FF, Z reset
    ld b, 0
    ; B = $00, Z reset
</pre>
<p>
    Remember how in the previous lesson, I said that <code>[hl]</code> basically was an 8-bit register? Well, it delivers: <code>inc [hl]</code> and <code>dec [hl]</code> are a thing! This directly modifies the byte in memory that <code>hl</code> points to, affecting flags.
</p>
<p>
    Also, for future reference, note that <code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code> modify the H an N flags. Given how little importance they have, I won't explain how yet.
</p>
<p>
    As for the 16-bit flavor of <code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code>, it takes any of the three 16-bit registers, and increments/decrements their content. The twist is, flags are preserved. All of them.
</p>

<h2>C - Carry</h2>
<p>
    This one is also straightforward... or confusing, because different instructions make it work differently. The general rule is: it <em>extends</em> the current operation. Confused? Here's a slow start: remember in the <a href="concepts.html">Basic Concepts</a> lesson, we talked about overflow, and I mentioned that "we don't have space to store that ninth bit"? Well, there isn't space to store it in the register itself, but <em>since the carry extends the current operation</em>, that ninth bit is stashed in the Carry bit/flag instead.
</p>

<h3>8-bit <code>add</code></h3>
<p>
    Here's a concrete example: now introducing the <code>add</code> instruction! It also comes in two flavors, but this will be discussed more in the next chapter. For now, we will consider <code>add a, X</code>, where X is either an 8-bit register, or an immediate 8-bit value. It basically takes <code>a</code>'s content, adds X to that, and stores the result back in <code>a</code>. This updates both the Z and C flags. (And the H and N flags, but we'll see that later.)
</p>
<pre>
    ld a, $EF
    ld b, $10

    add a, b
    ; A = $FF, Z reset, C reset
    add a, b
    ; A = $0F, Z reset, C set
    add a, b
    ; A = $1F, Z reset, C reset
    add a, $E1
    ; A = $00, Z set, C set
    add a, 0
    ; A = $00, Z set, C reset
</pre>
<p>
    We'll see different uses of the Carry flag in the upcoming lessons.
</p>

<h2>H &amp; N - The BCD flags</h2>
<p>
    These flags are updated by a lot of instructions, and they work in a kind of obtuse way... furthermore, they are used by exactly <em>one</em> instruction. What??!? Well, that instruction is pret~ty useful when doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">Binary-Coded Decimal (<abbr>BCD</abbr>)</a>. That will be discussed in the next section, because it's simpler to explain what it does than how it works. Don't worry, there will still be a detailed explanation for those whose OCD is triggering like crazy right now.
